            each other since we were babies. Although we would get on each other’s nerves, it was all because God’s grace we got this far.</p>

            My mom, who had lived in Palma, suggested it and invited us to attend their church’s anniversary service while we were there. 
            On Sunday, we got all dressed up and went to church, only to find out the anniversary service was actually the following week! 
            We laughed at how formal we looked and took our seats in front.</p>
            
            <p>During devotional worship, a guy with colorful socks came late to join the team. It was DJ. After the service, he came over 
            to shake my hand briefly and mentioned he had somewhere else to be. Surprisingly, that same night, he spent the rest of the time 
            chatting with the three friends I brought with me—but not me! I thought I must have seemed intimidating.</p>

            <p>The next day, out of the blue, he texted me. That conversation turned into many more, and now, almost six years later, we are getting married!</p>`,

            <p>When DJ tested my patience, I ran to Jesus. When we wanted to give up, we both turned to Him. We realized our relationship
            wasn't just between the two of us—it was a three-way bond with God at the center, our anchor and lifeline.</p>

            <p>DJ reminds me of God's grace every day. He receives it and gives it freely, even when it's hard. I'm so grateful to serve 
            alongside a man who is joyful, kind, and gentle-hearted.
