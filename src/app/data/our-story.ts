            and then singing Blessings, I knew that she would turn my world upside down. Angela and I became friends instantly as we had 
            known each other since we were babies, but it was all because God was our reason, and we would get on each other's nerves. 
            I thought she really liked me at first sight.`,

            She is so competitive, smart, diligent, determined, humble, does Taekwondo, the most beautiful in the Universe and she sings -- she is on another level. 
            More importantly, she loves Jesus. The more I know her, the more I love her.
            It is her grace, her mercy and love, that I know she is my Ezer.</p>

            suggested it and invited us to attend their church's anniversary service while we were there. On Sunday, we got all dressed up
            and went to church, only to find out the anniversary service was actually the following week! We laughed at how formal we looked
            and took our seats in front.`

            my hand briefly and mentioned he had somewhere else to be. Surprisingly, that same night, he spent the rest of the time chatting with 
            the three friends I brought with me—but not me! I thought I must have seemed intimidating.  
            The next day, out of the blue, he texted me. That conversation turned into many more, and now, almost six years later, we are getting married!`,

            <p>When DJ tested my patience, I ran to Jesus. When we wanted to give up, we both turned to Him. We realized our relationship
            wasn't just between the two of us—it was a three-way bond with God at the center, our anchor and lifeline.</p>

            <p>DJ reminds me of God's grace every day. He receives it and gives it freely, even when it's hard. I'm so grateful to serve 
            alongside a man who is joyful, kind, and gentle-hearted.
